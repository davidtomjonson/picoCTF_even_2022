## Problem: 
A program has been provided to you, what happens if you try to run it on the command line?
Download the program https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/308/run

## Solution: 
we will download that file, i have tried a few aways as strings, run, but it doesn't work. 
I try to use chmod +x run command and then use ./run command.
